# How to prepare a Technical Interview
### Hints and tips from my personal experience on how to get ready for your next technical interview.
### Focused on Bootcampers

##### 2023-06-21 by Alessandro Rodi

# The elephant in the room

As a Bootcamper you need to compete for the missing Bachelor or Master.

---

# The good news

...is that you made it to the technical interview!

---

# Different approaches

Different companies have very different approaches to the Technical Interview. 

**You'll have to face coding challenges.**

---

# Preparation

Code challenges are also known as code katas.

Practice every day. 10~15 minutes a day.

# Ask details about the process

You are not only allowed, but expected to ask questions about your future technical interview.

> Did the person show interest in the process?

---

# Some examples

* How long will the technical interview last?
* Shall I bring my laptop?
* Is there any software I must have pre-installed?
* Am I allowed to use copilot/chatGPT during one or more challenges?
* How do you evaluate/consider the usage of AI during the process? Is it a 👍 or a 👎?
* What technologies will be focus on during the interview? Languages/Framework

---

# More examples

* Will I spend the entire day at your company? 
* Do I get a chance to talk with other developers?
* Lunch together?
* Is there anything else I should prepare beforehand?
* What are the most important things that you evaluate, so that I can succeed?
* ...

---

# Challenge details

Once presented with the challenge. Do not think right away about the possible solution. Start with the requirements:

* Did you understand the problem?

This is a very important soft-skill: fetch all requirements.

> Did they ask questions?
> How well did they fetch requirements?

---

# Talk, talk, talk

Yes, you can solve the problem, but maybe not...
If the interviewer sits next to you, they want to talk with you!

> How does the person reason about the challenge? 
> What's the mental process?
> Can they explain what they are doing?

---

# Design patterns, SOLID, GRASP

These are topics not covered during the Bootcamp. 
* https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns
* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)

Be ready!

Study them in groups. Explain them to each other.
Challenge each other. Make your own opinion.

---

# Schema design

You studied it during the Bootcamp. This is very common in technical interviews!

> We need to implement an app for a library. The app has to record the loans of books to library members. Propose a database schema

> The interviewer is able to draw a database schema and knows the concepts of foreign and primary keys.

---

# SQL

Can you return all customers who did not perform any purchase yet, for the marketing team?

> The interviewer has basic knowledge of SQL.


---

# Code challenges - again

A very good platform to practice is Codingame

https://www.codingame.com

---

# Be careful of AI

AI is (as of today) often misleading. It might spit out a wrong solution. If you cannot recognise it, you are fucked.

---

# Say no

Don't pretend to know libraries and frameworks (or parts of them) that you never used.

Your interviewer will adapt their expectation and evaluation based on your knowledge.

* Do you know React? 

---

# Portfolio

You'd better have a Portfolio. 
Don't over-due it, the interviewers will recognize fake ones right away.
If you have a Portfolio or Github projects, your interviewer might want you to explain the code to them, and to rework it together.

---

# HTML

You followed a Web Developer bootcamp. You must know HTML.
Know the HTML tags and their usage.

---

# CSS

Basic knowledge of CSS is required. SCSS is a plus.
Be ready for exercises where you are asked to style.

> What is Bootstrap and what are the main differences with Tailwind?

> What is a SourceMap?

---

# Browser Inspector

Can you use the Browser inspector anbd debug tools?
If during the technical interview you can show how to use the Browser inspector and debug tools that is certainly a plus.

> Can you debug this Javascript error in the Browser?
> Can you style this component directly in the Browser?
---

# HTTP, HTTPS, Websockets

All generic concepts of the Web are a must.
They are expected from a Bootcamper!

> What does HTTP stands for? What about HTTPS? What is a Websocket and when is it useful?

---

# Javascript

Unfortunately you need to know a bit of Javascript too.
If the position requires you to work with Javascript frameworks, reinforce this part.
Learn about React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and be able to explain the difference between them.

> What is the difference between a Javascricpt library and a Javascricpt Framework?

---

# Ruby On Rails

If you apply for a Ruby On Rails position, it's your chance to shine!

You know the framework and this makes you plug-and-play for a company that uses this technology.

---

# Ruby On Rails - Specifics

* ActiveRecord
* ActionCable
* Assets Pipeline
* ERB templates

---

# Ruby On Rails - Testing

Not covered in the Bootcamp. 

Look into Minitest and RSpec. 

Ask what they use at the company you are applying for.

---

# Ruby On Rails - Hotwire

What is Turbo? How can it be used? Can you use it?

What is Stimulus? Can you use it?

---

# What does an evaluation table look like?
