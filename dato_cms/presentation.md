# Evaluation

I tried multiple tools, including..
* Strapi
* ButterCMS
* Firebase
* Kontent
* Contentful.

It's hard to do a proper evaluation with a little time.

---

# Evaluation

* Are all features supported?
* How easy is to integrate?
* How flexible is the tool?
* Price?
* What if tomorrow they require X, and the tool is not able to do it? üò±
