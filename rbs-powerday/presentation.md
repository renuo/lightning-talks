# Types!

# Example

```ruby
# my_class.rb

class MyClass
  def my_method(my_param)
    "#{my_param} rocks!"
  end
end
```

```ruby
# my_class.rbs
class MyClass
  def my_method : (my_param: String) -> String
end
```

# Separate files: d.ts ?

* You can define types only for the files you want
* You can partially type
* You can delete the `sig` folder at once

---

# Possible Excercises

* Investigate rbs and how the syntax looks like
* Split up in pairs. Some ideas:

* Integrate types in a gem
* Integrate types in a project
* Use types in Rubymine
* Use types in VSCode
* What are the differences between rbs and sorbet?
* What is steep? How do you use it?
* No rbs. I want to look into sorbet!
* rbs rails
