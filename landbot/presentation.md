# Considerations

Landbot follows the Anti-AI pattern.
It defies expectations with and intentionally simplified approach


---

# M - from Facebook

The chatbot reportedly only succeeded 30 percent of the time, and humans had to step in during the other instances.

---

# Google Duplex

Arguably the most advanced chatbot around today, is still limited to verifying business hours and making simple appointments.

---

# :angry:

Users expect far more than what AI chatbots can actually do, which tends to enrage them.

---

# I am a bot

Users don’t have to waste time thinking “Am I wording this question in a way the chatbot understands?” 
They can just click the button that corresponds to their response, then wait for Landbot’s next sentence.
