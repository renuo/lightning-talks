# Recap

---

# Revision-based deployment

1. Local code is checked out
2. `nctl` CLI is installed & authenticated
3. Deploio revision is set to the latest commit of the current branch (in our case `develop`)

_develop-deploy.yml_
```yaml
...
nctl update app $DEPLOIO_APP_NAME 
    --project $DEPLOIO_PROJECT 
    --git-revision=$(git rev-parse develop) 
    --build-env="RUBY_VERSION=$(cat .ruby-version)" 
```

---

# Limitations

- (Service account per project required)
- No response from Deploio -> **state of build & release is unknown**

# 4th step: check for build and release status

1. Local code is checked out
2. `nctl` CLI is installed & authenticated
3. Deploio revision is set to the latest commit of the current branch (in our case `develop`)
4. **NEW:** Build and release status is being polled continuously to ensure the deployment was successful on Deploio (`bin/check_deploio_deployment_status.rb`)
